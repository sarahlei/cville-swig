CS 4640 Web PL Project

Picture the following scenario: It’s nearing the end of the work day. You need a place to grab a cheap drink or maybe some tasty snacks. You wonder: “What day is today? Are there any happy hour specials today?” Acting as a “one-stop-shop”, our project, CvilleSwig, will involve creating a web-application that serves to display all the best happy hour spots in Charlottesville! No longer will you need to waste time finding the perfect spot for you and your friends. Cheers to that!
